    <p>Hi <B>Rebecca</B>,<br /><i>How ARE you?!</i><br />
        It's been ages!! I thought I'd drop you a line seeing as I'm stuck in the airport with nothing to do but make
        use of the free Wi-Fi.<br />
        Not that writing to you isn't top of my list of things to do, of course ;) <br />
        but I've been totally snowed under at work, plus all the family stuff that's been going on ... Anyway,<br />
        I'm just about to go on a much-needed holiday so I really can't complain! <br />
        Anyhoo … what have you been up to?
        <em >saw Carol a couple of months ago – don't know if you heard wha happened with her job but it made me feel
            grateful I only slightly hate mine </em><br />
        she was saying your book is going to be published?! GREAT news!!! Send me a link and I'll definitely buy it and
        leave a five-star review :)<br />

        As for me, same old, same old re: job. Maggie and I broke up a while ago, as you know,<br />
        but we're getting on much better now and it's working out far better for the kids.<br />

        No-one new on the horizon but I'm off to Canada travelling for a month (if this plane ever leaves!) so who
        knows?!

        Actually,<strong>I'll be flying over your house in a few hours</strong><br> I'll wave! Let's make a plan to see
        each other when I get back, OK?

        Hope life's treating you well!

        Lots of love,
        <br /><br /><br />
        <B>Sara </B>
